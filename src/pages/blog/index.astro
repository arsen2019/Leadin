const loremContent = `Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
 industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
  took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
   but also the leap into electronic typesetting`;
